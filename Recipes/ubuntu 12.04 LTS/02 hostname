You'll need to set your system's hostname and fully qualified domain name (FQDN). 
Your hostname should be something unique. Some people name their servers after planets, philosophers, or animals. 
Note that the system's hostname has no relationship to websites or email services hosted on it, 
aside from providing a name for the system itself. Your hostname should not be "www" or anything too generic.

Enter following commands to set the hostname, replacing plato with the hostname of your choice:

echo "plato" > /etc/hostname
hostname -F /etc/hostname

If it exists, edit the file /etc/default/dhcpcd to comment out the SET_HOSTNAME directive:

File excerpt:/etc/default/dhcpcd

#SET_HOSTNAME='yes'

//- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

//- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Next, edit your /etc/hosts file to resemble the following example, replacing plato with your chosen hostname, example.com
with your system's domain name, and 12.34.56.78 with your system's IP address. As with the hostname, 
the domain name part of your FQDN does not necesarily need to have any relationship to websites 
or other services hosted on the server (although it may if you wish). 
As an example, you might host "www.something.com" on your server, but the system's FQDN might be "mars.somethingelse.com."

File:/etc/hosts

127.0.0.1        localhost.localdomain    localhost
127.0.0.1 		 foo.localdomain 		  foo
12.34.56.78      plato.example.com        plato

If you have IPv6 enabled on your Linode, you will also want to add an entry for your IPv6 address, as shown in this example:

File:/etc/hosts

127.0.0.1                       localhost.localdomain    localhost
127.0.0.1 		 				foo.localdomain 		 foo
12.34.56.78                     plato.example.com        plato
::1     foo  localhost6.localdomain6  localhost6
2600:3c01::a123:b456:c789:d012  plato.example.com        plato

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

The value you assign as your system's FQDN should have an "A" record in DNS pointing to your Linode's IPv4 address. 
For server with IPv6 enabled, you should also set up a "AAAA" record in DNS pointing to your server's IPv6 address.
